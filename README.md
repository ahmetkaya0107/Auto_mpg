Transforming Data and Optimizing ML Regression Models

We will prepare data for machine learning and compare the performance of different machine learning regression models on the Auto-MPG data set. In this project, I have compared 11 forms of regressions on Auto-MPG data set. Each model has different predictive ability on the boundary of the training dataset. For excample, while Ridge regression allows you to analyze data even when severe multicollinearity is present and helps prevent overfitting, Lasso regression (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) performs a variable selection that aims to increase prediction accuracy by identifying a simpler model. Each form has its own importance and a specific condition where they are best suited to apply.
The following regression models will be studied:

1. Ordinary Least Squares Regression

2. Stepwize Linear Regression

3. Principal Component Regression (PCA)

4. Partial Least Squares Regression

5. Ridge Regression

6. Random Forest Regression

7. Support Vector Regression

8. Lasso Regression

9.Decision Tree Regression

10. Quantile Regression

11. kNN Regression
